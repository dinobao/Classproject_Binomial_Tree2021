# Classproject_Binomial_Tree2021
This is the code for our teams' project in class "Options , futures and other derivatives". We used both Python and MATLAB to finish the project, the code "project_python" is our Python code, the code "project_Call_MATLAB" is our MATLAB code for call option and the code "project_Put_MATLAB" is our MATLAB code for put option. Thanks for all the teammates.
